Pig Dice Game

Overview

Welcome to the Pig Dice Game! This is a simple and entertaining dice game that can be played by two players. The game involves rolling a six-sided die and accumulating points, but beware of the risk of losing all your points in a single turn!

How to Play 

Objective: The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a set number of points, typically 100.

Gameplay:

1. Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die.
2. Each turn, a player can choose to roll the die or hold.
3. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current turn's points and their turn ends.
4. If a player rolls a number other than 1, that number is added to their turn total.
5. Players can choose to hold, which adds their turn total to their overall score, and the turn passes to the other player.

Winning:

1. The game continues until one player reaches the set winning score (e.g., 100 points).
2. The first player to reach or exceed the winning score is declared the winner.
